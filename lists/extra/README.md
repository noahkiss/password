# Extra Wordlists
This is a list of extra word lists for the project. The are not included in the
HTML source, so they are not loaded when client loads the page. However, they
are available if you want to use them.

## Alternate
### Colors
This `alternative_colors_full.js` word list contains 2,433 colors to use. This
will greatly increase the character count of the "Colors" generator, but I
spent so much time putting this together, it would be a shame to throw it out.
So, here it is. This does include the shortest 1,025 color names that are in
the default list. So, this list only adds an extra 1,408 unique words.

### Trump
Now that the Trump passphrase generator is 8,192 words in length, only the
shortest 8,192 words will be commited to the generater. However, there is a lot
of highly themed Trump tweets that would be thrown out, so now it's preserved
here.
